h2. Requirements

ruby-1.9.3-p448
java 1.5 or higher (in order to run solr under a jetty)
RVM (recommended for development)

In addition, you should have Bundler and Rails ruby gems installed:

<pre>gem install bundler
gem install rails
</pre>

h2. Installation guide

<pre>
git checkout git@github.com:uohull/blah.git
</pre>

Change the current directory to "blah"

The project includes a .rvmrc file which will define a Ruby version and gemset that should be used for the project.  In this case ruby-1.9.3-p448 and gemset 'blah'.  

To install the required gems, execute:
<pre>
bundle install
</pre>

To create the necessary blacklight database tables, run the database migrations:
<pre>
rake db:migrate
</pre>

h2. Running...

The configurations for the Blah application are stored in config/blah_config.yml.

To run you must first ensure that the local Solr server is running, by navigating blah/jetty directory and..
<pre>
java -jar start.jar &
</pre>

Index test MARC records using the existing rake task...
<pre>
rake solr:marc:index_test_data
</pre>

Start the rails application:
<pre>
rails server
</pre>

h2. Indexing test data

e-resources are indexed into solr from a locally produced csv file. A sample file is located in test/fixtures/e-resource.csv - To index this into the local solr instance, execute...

<pre>
curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/update/csv?f.subject_topic_facet.split=true&f.subject_topic_facet.separator=%5E&f.subject_t.split=true&f.subject_t.separator=%5E&commit=true" --data-binary @eresources.csv -H 'Content-type:text/plain; charset=utf-8'
</pre>

This utilises the solr csv update manager, and splits the subject_topic_facet and subject_t column based upon the %5E char (^).
