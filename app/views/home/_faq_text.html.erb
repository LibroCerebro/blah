<h1>Blacklight FAQ <small>A change of interface</small></h1>

  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Why have a different interface?</h3>
    <p>Library catalogues were quick to exploit the web in the 1990s and develop a range of web interfaces that greatly facilitated access to library collections.  As the web has developed the ability to search for almost anything has evolved hugely, and library systems have not always managed to keep up.  This different interface seeks to make use of current web trends in providing access to the library catalogue in ways that our current catalogue cannot provide.  It also makes use of recent design trends in the presentation of search services.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Why run both interfaces alongside each other?</h3>
    <p>Notwithstanding the introduction of new functionality and design, we don’t wish to pre-judge whether this interface is better than the current one without hearing from you, the people who use the library catalogue to find stuff.  We very much value your feedback on what you like and don’t like about both interfaces, plus what additional functionality and services it would be useful to provide.</p>
  </div>
   <div class="text-block">
    <h3>How can I give feedback or make suggestions?</h3>
    <p>Please use the feedback form that is available in the bottom lefthand corner of each page of this interface, or send your feedback to <a href="mailto:libhelp@hull.ac.uk">libhelp@hull.ac.uk</a>. The more feedback we get, the better we can make the library catalogue work for you.</p>
   </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>What’s different about this interface?</h3>
    <p>The main differences are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A simpler single search box for all materials (with an advanced search where preferred)</li>
      <li>More extensive indexing of the catalogue records to facilitate access</li>
      <li>The use of facets to assist with narrowing a search and browsing the collection</li>
      <li>Clearer indication of the availability of items</li>
      <li>Guidance on citing items and the ability to share them with others via social media</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Searching the catalogue</h2>

  <div class="text-block" id="searching">
    <h3>What are facets?</h3>
    <p>Facets are different views of a collection.  For example, the Library facet on the main search page shows you a view of the collection broken down by the library holding the items; the Format facet shows the same collection viewed by format of the material.  A range of facets are available, and have been made possible by the indexing of the catalogue that this interface supports.  Facets are used by many Internet shopping and other web sites, and work here in similar ways to elsewhere on the web.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Why did I get those results?</h3>
    <p>Searching the catalogue will search the whole catalogue record, which is often richer than what is displayed.  Hence, you may occasionally retrieve items that don’t appear to match your search.  Don’t worry, they do, but just not as obviously as you might have thought.  One way of checking is to look at the Librarian view for an individual item, as this shows the whole record.</p>
  </div>       
</section>

 <section id="features">
    <h2>Additional features</h2>

  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Availability</h3>
    <p>More detailed, colour-coded, availability information has been included on the search results page to give an instant view of whether the items are accessible.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Book covers</h3>
    <p>Book cover images have been added to provide a guide to items.  Please note that the exact book cover may not always match the image, but the information is kept up-to-date and accurate as far as is possible.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Facets</h3>
    <p>See above for a description of facets and how they can be used</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Cite</h3>
    <p>On individual item pages a Cite option displays information on how the item might be cited in a bibliography using a number of commonly used styles.  Please note this is offered as guidance only and detailed citation requirements should be checked with Departments.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Share</h3>
    <p>Individual items can be shared via a range of social media services. Additional services can be added to the list.  If you have a favourite, let us know.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="nowtesting">
  <h2>Now testing... <small>A number catalogue features have now been implemented in Blacklight, and we welcome feedback on them. Please check back occasionally to see the latest changes as we develop Blacklight further.</small></h2>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Requesting</h3>
    <p>Individual item pages now enable you the Request an item.  The feature will take you through to the current catalogue request screens; please proceed as normal from there.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Booking</h3>
    <p>Individual items in Short Loan at the BJL can now be Booked.  As for requesting, the link will take you through to the current catalogue screens, and the booking module within this; please proceed as normal from there.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Search links</h3>
    <p>Author names and subject terms are now linkable.  Clicking on one of these will search for other items by the same author, or items on the same subject.</p>    
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <h3>Library facet</h3>
    <p>The Library facet has now been amended to give more accurate figures of the total numbers of items in each of our libraries.  Some additional work is ongoing to correct the figures fully, though let us know if any figure appears to be incorrect.  As before, limiting by the Location facet does, though, provide accurate details of where items can be found.</p>
